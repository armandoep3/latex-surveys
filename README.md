# Latex Surveys
Template for nicely formatted surveys in LaTeX.

Adapted for code QA questionnaire.

This code was first authored by [Sven Hartenstein](www.svenhartenstein.de). I found it [here](http://www.svenhartenstein.de/creating-questionnaires-with-latex/) and thought it would be good to share on GitHub.

Ideally, one should build a LaTeX package from this code (shouldn't be too difficult).
